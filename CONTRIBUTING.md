# Contributing

Curl uses [ztest](https://github.com/jaz303/ztest), [PHPStan](https://phpstan.org/), and [PHP_CodeSniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer), which are all included as dev dependencies in `composer.json`.  These tools are used to help prevent bugs, to ensure that the code is of a high standard.

## Running the Tests

1. Run `composer install` to install *all* dependencies
1. Run `composer app:check-quality` to run all tests
